## Key Features Deep Dive

### 🎯 Smart Recommendations (Phase 3A)

The recommendations engine uses a sophisticated multi-factor algorithm:

**Algorithm Factors:**
1. **Direct Preference Match** (40%) - What the kid already loves/likes
2. **Parent Influence** (20%) - Parent's activity preferences
3. **Similar Kids** (20%) - Collaborative filtering using cosine similarity
4. **Teacher Observations** (10%) - Professional insights
5. **Context Matching** (10%) - Time, weather, energy level
6. **Novelty Boost** (5%) - Encourage trying new things
7. **Recency Penalty** (15%) - Promote variety

**User Customization:**
- Adjust any factor weight via intuitive sliders
- Quick presets: Balanced, Kid-Led, Parent-Guided, Discovery
- Settings persist per family

**Performance:**
- Sub-100ms query response time
- PostgreSQL-native (no external services)
- Nightly similarity computation
- Scales to 5,000+ kids efficiently

See `PHASE3A_COMPLETE.md` for detailed documentation.
